Tips:
Always check https://github.com/jpaik15190/Reversi to see if any changes need to be pulled to your local repository.

Always push your changes to github after you've made changes to avoid a situation where another person starts working on an older version of the file and we end up with conflicting copies.

Do not make changes directly from the github website, as doing so will not update your local repository.

How to Push Changes:
$ git add . (this adds all updated files in the current directory to the queue to be committed)
$ git commit -am "comment" (this commits changes made to the files in the local repository)
$ git push (this pushes all of the changes committed to github)

How to Pull Changes:
Navigate to your local repository (../Reversi)
$ git pull

Additional Commands:
$ git status (view changes to be committed/pushed)
$ git log (view recent changes that were pushed by you/others, Ctrl + Z to exit)

Basic Unix Commands:
$ ls (lists the folders/files in the current path)
$ cd <path> (navigate to the path, '..' goes up one level)
$ pwd (prints the current working directory)
$ touch <filename> (makes a blank file of the given name in the pwd)
$ cat <filename> (displays the contents of the file on the terminal)
