Always check https://github.com/jpaik15190/Reversi to see if any changes need to be pulled to your local repository.

Always push your changes to github after you've made changes to avoid a situation where another person starts working on an older version of the file and we end up with conflicting copies.

<b>How to Push Changes</b>
$ git add . (this adds all updated files in the current directory to the queue to be committed)
$ git commit -am "comment" (this commits changes made to the files in the local repository)
$ git push (this pushes all of the changes committed to github)

<b>How to Pull Changes</b>
Navigate to your local repository (../Reversi)
$ git pull

<b>Additional Commands</b>
$ git status (view changes to be committed/pushed)
$ git log (view recent changes that were pushed by you/others, Ctrl + Z to exit)

<b>Basic Unix Commands</b>
$ ls (lists the folders/files in the current path)
$ cd <path> (navigate to the path, '..' goes up one level)
$ pwd (prints the current working directory)
$ touch <filename> (makes a blank file of the given name in the pwd)
$ cat <filename> (displays the contents of the file on the terminal)
